# CS305-Assignment-5
A repository for use throughout assignment 5 in CS305. 

This is a readme file that provides all kinds of incredible and hard to reach information. You cannot find such valuable information anywhere else, and if you do the odds that they copied that information from this readme are extremely high. Thank you!

I would like to work on a project that helps users locate potentially hidden files on their computer.
