# CS305-Assignment-5
## A repository for use throughout assignment 5 in CS305. 

### **My Project**:

I would like to work on a project that ~~helps users locate potentially hidden files on their computer~~ allows users to input ingredients that they have on hand, then output the different kinds of food they could make with it.

> There are many reasons I want to make a project like this:
>
> One being that I have kind of started a project like this before, but could not finish it due to lack of time/understanding of coding fundamentals.
>
> Now I want to finish this code and continue improving it so that I can have a fully fleshed out program under my neck. 

#### Things that I may need to do in order to finish this project:

1. Learn how to search the web using the user's imputs
   - This includes returning some of the websearch results back to the user. 
   - Ohter thing
   - Other thing
2. Rework existing sections of the code
3. These are things that I would like to do


### Potential New Module:
> I believe that it would be cool if you could somehow connect with grubhub or doordash to have them get this food sent to them.
